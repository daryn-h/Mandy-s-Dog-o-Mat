 Web Design 2 Final Project

## Creator
Daryn Hancock

## Description
This project is a redesign of the website for a local self-serve pet grooming salon.  The existing site is difficult to navigate with inconsistent style choices and not optimized for mobile.  The site provides information about services, pricing, and how the business operates.  The site is informative, approachable, and designed to show the pet-loving atmosphere of Mandy's Dog 'o' Mat.  

## Target Audience
The primary audience is local pet owners who are looking for a budget-friendly DIY alternative to professional pet washing and grooming.  The secondary audience is dog walkers and pet sitters or other pet care professionals who care for several dogs and need a reliable place to take care of them.  

## Project Goals 
- Inform users about what services Mandy's offers. 
- Helps users easily locate hours, pricing, what to expect, and contact info.  
- Highlight why self-serve dog washing is so beneficial.  
- Emphasize trust and increase engagement with reviews and photos.  
- Provide responsiveness across devices for mobile users.
